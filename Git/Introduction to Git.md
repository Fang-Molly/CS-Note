    * many version control systems, includes Git

* **Git strength** :

    * Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.

    * automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.

    * synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.
