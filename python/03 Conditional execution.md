<class 'bool'> 
>>> type(False) 
<class 'bool'>
```
* comparison operators
   * x==y ------ x is equal to y
   * x!=y------ x is not equal to y
   * x>y ------ x is greater than y
   * x<y ------  x is less than y
   * x>=y ------  x is greater than or equal to y
   * x<=y  ------  x is less than or equeal to y
   * x is y ------  x is the same as y
   * x is not y ------ x is not the same as y
