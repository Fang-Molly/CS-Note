# 1.1 Creativity and motivation

# 1.2 Computer hardwarre architecture

* **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
   * CPU is built to be obsessed with “what is next?”
   
* **Main Memory**
   * Store information that the CPU needs in a hurry.
   * Nearly as fast as the CPU
   * The information stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.
   
* **Secondary Memory**
   * Store information
   * Much slower than the main memory
   * It can store information even when there is no power to the computer.
   * Disk drives or flash memory 

* **Input and Output Devices**
   * screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc.
   
* **Network Connection**
   * retrieve information
   * a slower and at times unreliable form of secondary memory.

# 1.3 Understanding programming

* First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You can spell the words and construct sentences.

* Second, you need to tell a story.

# 1.4 Words and sentences

* **reserved words**

and; as; assert; break; class; continue; def; del; elif; else; expect; inally; for; from; global; if; import; in;       
is; lambda; nonlocal; not; or; pass; raise; return; try; while; with; yield    

* **variables**

* **function print**
   * print( )
   * enclosed in quotes, single quotes and double quotes do the same thing
      * print('Hello world!') 
      * print("Hello world!")
   * most people use single quotes
   * use double quotes when apostrophe appears in the string
      * print("It's a dog.")
   
# 1.5 Conversing with Python

## start python

* Open your **terminal** 
   * The "$" is the operating system prompt
* type **Python3** and press **enter**

* execute **Python interpreter** in **interactive mode**.
   * The `>>>` prompt showed up
   * pype python commands after >>> prompt
   
```
liufangdeMacBook-Pro:~ FangLiu$ python3
Python 3.8.1 (v3.8.1:1b293b6006, Dec 18 2019, 14:08:53) 
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
>>> print ('Hello world!')
Hello world!
```

## end python

* quit()

* Hit CTRL-Z(^Z)
   
* Hit CTRL-D(^D)

# 1.6 Terminology: Interpreter and compiler

* Python is **a high-level language** intended to be relatively straightforward for human to read and write and for computers to read and process.

* The CPU understands a language we call **machine language**, it is represented all in zeros and ones.

# 1.7 Writing a program

* use a **text editor** to write the Python instructions into a file, which is called a **script**.
* Python scripts have names that end with **.py**

```
$ cat hello.py
print('Hello world!)
$ python hello.py
Hello world!
```
* There is no need to have quit() at the end of the Python program in the file.
