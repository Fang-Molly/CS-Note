* **counter** A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and then incremented.

* **empty string** A string with no characters and length 0, represented by two quo- tation marks.

* **format operator** An operator, %, that takes a format string and a tuple and gen- erates a string that includes the elements of the tuple formatted as specified by the format string.

* **format sequence** A sequence of characters in a format string, like %d, that spec- ifies how a value should be formatted.

* **format string** A string, used with the format operator, that contains format sequences.

* **flag** A boolean variable used to indicate whether a condition is true or false. 

* **invocation** A statement that calls a method.

* **immutable** The property of a sequence whose items cannot be assigned.

* **index** An integer value used to select an item in a sequence, such as a character in a string.

* **item** One of the values in a sequence.

* **method** A function that is associated with an object and called using dot notation.

* **object** Something a variable can refer to. For now, you can use “object” and “value” interchangeably.

* **search** A pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for. 

* **sequence** An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index.

* **slice** A part of a string specified by a range of indices.

* **traverse** To iterate through the items in a sequence, performing a similar operation on each.
