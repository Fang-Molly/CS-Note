Introduction to Git
===================

# 1 Basic workflow

## 1.1 Version control

* **Version control system** : a tool manages changes made to the files and directories in a project

* **Git** :

    * Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.

    * Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.

    * Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.

## 1.2 Where does Git store information?

* **Git project has two parts, called a repository**

	* The files and directories that you create and edit directly
	* The extra information that Git records about the project's history.
		* Git stores in a directory called `.git` located in the root directory of the repository
		* Git expects this information to be laid out in a very precise way, so you should never edit or delete anything in `.git`.

* **Check the state of a repository**

	* `git status`: displays a list of the files that have been modified since the last time changes were saved

## 1.3 How can I tell what I have changed?

* **Staging area**
	* It stores files with changes you want to save that haven't been saved yet
	* You can add more things to the staging area, but once commited you can't make further changes
	* `git status`: show you which files are in this staging area, and which files have changes that haven't yet been put there.

* **What is in a diff**
	* A diff is a formatted display of the differences between two sets of files.
	* `git diff`: show you all the changes in your repository
	* `git diff directory`: show you the changes to the files in some directory

* **Commit changes to a Git repository in two steps:**
	* Add one or more files to the staging area
	* Commit everything in the staging area
