# What is Data Science?

## 1. What can data do?

* Describe the current state of an organization or process

* Detect anomalous events

* Diagnose the causes of events and behaviors

* Predict future events

## 2. The data science workflow

* Data collection

* Exploration and visualization

* Experimentation and prediction


# Applications of Data Science

## 1. Traditional machine learning

* Fraud detection

## 2. Internet of Things (IoT)

* Smart watches

* Internet-connected home security systems

* Electronic toll collection systems

* Building energy management systems

## 3. Deep Learning

* Many neurons work together

* Requires much more training data

* Used in complex problems

    * Image classification

    * Language learning / understanding
