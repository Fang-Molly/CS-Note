Object-Oriented Programming with S3 and R6 in R
===============================================

# 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 1.1 What is Object-Oriented Programming?

In OOP, functions are known as methods. 

OOP works best when you have a limited number of objects that you completely understand the behavior of. 

	* bioconductor
	* apis
	* graphical user interfaces, or GUIs. 

* with functional programming, you think about the functions first, and then how you use them on your data. 

* With object-oriented programming, you think about the data structures first, then worry about their functionality. 

# 1.2 The Nine Systems

* **No longer used**

	* **R5** and **mutatr** were both experimental systems that never made it into real-world use before being abandoned. It’s almost impossible to use these, even if you wanted to.

	* **OOP** is defunct and no longer available. 

	* **proto** had a brief moment of popularity as the underlying system in early versions of the ggplot2 package but is no longer really used.

	* **R-dot-oo** has been around for years, but hasn’t really taken off at all. 

* **Need to learn**

	* The **S3** system was introduced in the third version of the S language that was the precursor to R. It’s been around since the 1980s, so it’s completely mature, and still in wide use. S3 is a very simple system. In fact it only implements one feature of object-oriented programming, that is, the ability to have functions work in different ways on different types of object. It’s a one-trick pony, but it’s a great trick. Using S3 is a fundamental R skill that you need to learn. 

	* **S4** was introduced, as you might be able to guess, in the fourth version of S. Again, that means that it is mature, and there’s a lot of code built with it. Unfortunately, it’s also a bit weird, so in most cases I don’t recommend S4 as a first choice for new projects. There is one exception to this: most of the packages on Bioconductor use S4, so if you work with ‘omics data, then S4 is an essential skill. 

	* **ReferenceClasses** are an attempt to create a system that behaves similarly to popular object-oriented languages like Java or C#. You get powerful features like encapsulation and inheritance. However, I’m hesitant to recommend it as your first choice for new projects because of the last system that we’re going to discuss. 

	* **R6** covers much of the same ground as ReferenceClasses but does so in a simpler way. This means that the code is a little easier to work with, and is higher performance.

> **Summary**
	
	* Use S3 regularly
	* Use R6 when you need more power
	* Use S4 for Bioconductor
	* Maybe use ReferenceClasses
