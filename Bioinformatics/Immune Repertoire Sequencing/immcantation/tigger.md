TIgGER: Tool for Immunoglobulin Genotype Elucidation via Rep-Seq
================================================================

# Introduction

TIgGER is a computational method that significantly improves V(D)J allele assignments by first determining the complete set of gene segments carried by an individual (including novel alleles) from V(D)J-rearrange sequences. TIgGER can then infer a subjectâ€™s genotype from these sequences, and use this genotype to correct the initial V(D)J allele assignments.
