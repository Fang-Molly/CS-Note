# Chapter 1 Introduction to Data Science

## 1. What is Data Science?

### What can data do?

* Describe the current state of an organization or process

* Detect anomalous events

* Diagnose the causes of events and behaviors

* Predict future events

### The data science workflow

* Data collection

* Exploration and visualization

* Experimentation and prediction

## 2. Applications of Data Science

### Traditional machine learning

### Data science team structure

* Isolated: contain one or multiple types of data employees

    * Data - Engineering - Design & Product

* Embedded


* Hybrid


# Chapter 2 Data Collection and Storage

## 1. Data sources and risks

### Common sources of data

* Web events

* Customer data

* Logistics data

* Financial transactions

### Web data

Events - Timestamps - User information

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

### Data pseudonymization

### Data anonymization

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

* Applied to all data inside of the EU

* Give individuals control over their personal data

* Regulates how long data can be stored

* Mandates appropriate anonymization

* Disclose data collection and gain consent

## 2. Solicated data

### Why do we solicit data?

* Create marketing collateral

* De-risk decision making

* Monitor quality

### Types of solicited data

* Surveys

* Customer reviews

* In-app questionnaires

* Focus groups

Qualitative

    * Conversations
    * Open-ended questions
    
Quantitative

    * Multiple choice
    * Rating scale
    
### Revealed and stated preferences

* Stated perference

    * Hypothetical
    * Subjective

* Revealed preference

    * Actions
    * Purchasing decisions

## 3. Collecting additional data

### Even more data

* APIs
* Public records
* Mechanical Turk

### Data APIs

* Application Programming Interface
* Request data over the internet
* Twitter, Wikipedia, Google Maps

### Tracking a hashtag

* All tweets with `#DataFramed`
* Use Twitter API

### Public records

* For the US, data.gov
* For the EU, data.europa.eu

### Building a training set

### Mechanical Turk

* Resource: AWS MTurk
* Label customer reviews
* Extract text from a form
* Highlight key words in a sentence

## 4. Data storage and retrieval

### Parallel storage solutions

### The cloud

### Tyepes of data storage

* Unstructured - Document Database
    * Email
    * Text
    * Video and audio files
    * Web pages
    * Social media
    
* Tabular - Relational Database

### Data querying

* Document Database - NoSQL
* Relational Database - SQL

### Putting it all together: Location

* On-premises cluster
* Cloud privider:
    * Azure
    * AWS
    * Google Cloud
    
### Putting it all together: Data type

### Putting it all together: Queries

# Chapter 3 Analysis and Visualization

## 1. Dashboards

### What is a dashboard?

* A set of metrics, usually in the form of graphs, that update on a schedule.
* update in realtime or daily or weekly

### Tracking a value over time

### Tracking composition over time

### Categorical cpmparison

### Highlighting a single number

### Displaying text

### Where can we build a dashboard?

* Spreadsheets: Excel or Google Sheets
* BI Tools: BI, Tableau, Looker
* Customized tools: R Shiny or d3.js

### Requesting a dashboard

## 2. Ad hoc analysis

### What is an ad hoc request?

* Not repeated on a weekly or daily basis
* Can come from many places
    * Product
    * Finance
    * Engineering
    

## 3. A/B Testing
