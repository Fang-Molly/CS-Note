# 1.1 Creativity and motivation

# 1.2 Computer hardwarre architecture

* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
   * CPU is built to be obsessed with “what is next?”
   
* Main Memory
   * Store information that the CPU needs in a hurry.
   * Nearly as fast as the CPU
   * The information stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.
   
* Secondary Memory
   * Store information
   * Much slower than the main memory
   * It can store information even when there is no power to the computer.
   * Disk drives or flash memory 

* Input and Output Devices
   * screen, keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc.
   
* Network Connection
   * retrieve information
   * a slower and at times unreliable form of secondary memory.

# 1.3 Understanding programming

* First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the vocabulary and the grammar. You can spell the words and construct sentences.

* Second, you need to tell a story.

# 1.4 Words and sentences

* reserved words

* variables

# 1.5 Conversing with Python

* Open your **terminal** and type **Python3**, the **Python interpreter** will start executing in **interactive mode**.

```
liufangdeMacBook-Pro:~ FangLiu$ python3
Python 3.8.1 (v3.8.1:1b293b6006, Dec 18 2019, 14:08:53) 
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 

# You can type python commands after the interactive chevron >>> prompt

```
* The "$" is the operating system prompt

* The `>>>` prompt is the Python interpreter's way of asking you, “What do you want me to do next?”

```
>>> print ('Hello world!')
Hello world!
```

* The proper way to say "goodbye" to Python

   * quit()

   ```
   >>> quit()
   ```
   * Hit CTRL-Z(^Z)
   
   * Hit CTRL-D(^D)

# 1.6 Terminology: Interpreter and compiler

* Python is **a high-level language** intended to be relatively straightforward for human to read and write and for computers to read and process.

* The CPU understands a language we call **machine language**, it is represented all in zeros and ones.

# 1.7 Writing a program

* use a **text editor** to write the Python instructions into a file, which is called a **script**.
* Python scripts have names that end with **.py**

```
$ cat hello.py
print('Hello world!)
$ python hello.py
Hello world!
```
* There is no need to have quit() at the end of the Python program in the file.
