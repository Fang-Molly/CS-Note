# 2. Data Collection and Storage

## 2.1 Data sources

* Company data   
	* Collected by companies
	* Helps them make data-driven decisions
	* Web events
		* Events - Timestamps - User information
	* Survey data
		 * Asking people for their opinions
		 * Methods:
		     * Face-to-face interview
		     * Online questionnaire
	* Customer data
	* Logistics data
	* Financial transactions
* Open data
    * Free, open data sources
    * Can be used, shared, and built-on by anyone
    * Public data APIs
        * Application Programming Interface
        * Request data over the internet
    * Public records
        * International organizations
            * e.g.: World Bank, UN, WTO
        * National statistical offices
            * e.g.: censuses, surveys
        * Government agencies
            * e.g.: weather, environment, population

## 2.2 Data types

* Why care about data types?
	* Important later on when:
		* Storing the data
		* Visualizing/analyzing the data
		
* Quantitative vs qualitative data
	* Quantitative data
		* Deals with numbers
		* Data can be measured
	* Qualitative data
		* Deals with descriptions
		* Data can be observed but not measured

* Other data types
	* Image data
	* Text data
	* Geospatial data
	* Network data
	* ...

## 2.3 Data storage and retrieval

* Things to consider when storing data
	* Location
		* Parallel storage solutions: cluter or server
		* The cloud
	* Data type
		* Unstructured: Document Database
			* Email, text, video and audio files, web pages, social media
		* Tabular: Relational Database
	* Retrieval: Data querying
		*  Document database: NoSQL
		*  Relational database: SQL(Structured Query Language)

## 2.4 Data Pipelines

* What is a data pipeline
	* Moves data into defined stages
	* Automated collection and storage
		* Scheduled hourly, daily, weekly, etc
		* Triggered by an event
    * Monitored with generated alerts
    * Necessary for big data projects
    * Data engineers work to customize solutions
    * Extract Transform Load (ETL) 

# 3. Preparation, Exploration, and Visualization





# Chapter 3 Analysis and Visualization

## 1. Dashboards

### What is a dashboard?

* A set of metrics, usually in the form of graphs, that update on a schedule.
* update in realtime or daily or weekly

### Tracking a value over time

### Tracking composition over time

### Categorical cpmparison

### Highlighting a single number

### Displaying text

### Where can we build a dashboard?

* Spreadsheets: Excel or Google Sheets
* BI Tools: BI, Tableau, Looker
* Customized tools: R Shiny or d3.js

### Requesting a dashboard

## 2. Ad hoc analysis

### What is an ad hoc request?

* Not repeated on a weekly or daily basis
* Can come from many places
    * Product
    * Finance
    * Engineering
