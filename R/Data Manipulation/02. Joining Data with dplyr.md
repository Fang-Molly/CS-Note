Joining Data with dplyr
=======================

# 1. Joining Tables

## 1.1 The inner_join verb

* **Inner join**

```R
# link the column in the first table to the column in the second table
sets %>%
	inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"))
```

* **Customizing your join**

```R
# append suffix name to the shared columns, much more readable name
sets %>%
	inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_theme"))
```

* **Most common themes**

```R
# find out the most common themes 
sets %>%
	inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_theme")) %>%
	count(name_theme, sort = TRUE)
```


## 1.2 Joining with a one-to-many relationship

* Filtering the joined table 

```R
sets %>%
	# join by the same name
	inner_join(inventories, by = "set_num")
	filter(version == 1)
```
  
## 1.3 Joining three or more tables

* **Adding another join**

```R
sets %>%
	inner_join(inventories, by = "set_num") %>%
	inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_set", "_theme"))
```

# 2. Left and Right Joins

## 2.1 The left_join verb

```R
invertory_parts_joined <- inventories %>%
	inner_join(inventory_parts, by = c("id" = "inventory_id")) %>%
	select(-id, -version) %>%
	arrange(desc(quantity))
```

* **Fliter**

```R
batmobile <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
	filter(set_num == "7784-1") %>%
	select(-set_num)
	
batwing <- inventory_parts_joined %>%
	filter(set_num == "70916-1") %>%
	select(-set_num)
```

* **Joining with multiple columns**

```R
batmobile %>%
	inner_join(batwing, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_batmobile", "_batwing"))
```

* **The left join**

		* keep all the observations from the first (or "left") table

```
batmobile %>%
	left_join(batwing, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_batmobile", "_batwing"))
```

## 2.2 The right-join verb

* **The right join**

		* Keep all the observations in the second (or "right") table

```R
batmobile %>%
	right_join(batwing, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_batmoblie", "_batwing"))
```

* **Count and sort**

```R
sets %>%
	# count how many times the theme_id happens
	count(theme_id, sort = TRUE) %>%
	# add more information
	inner_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id))
```

* **Replace NAs**

```R
sets %>%
	count(theme_id, sort = TRUE) %>%
	right_join(themes, by = c("theme_id" = "id")) %>%
	replace_na(list(n = 0))
```

* **Compariation**

		* inner_join : keep only observations that match perfectly between tables
		* left_join : keep all observations in the first table, including matching observations in the second table
		* right_join : keep all observations in the second table, including matching observations in the first table

## 2.3 Joining tables to themselves

```R
# join tables to themselves
themes %>%
	inner_join(themes, by = c("parent_id" = "id"))
	
# add a suffix
themes %>%
	inner_join(themes, by = c("parent_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_child", "_parent")
	
# filter
themes %>%
	inner_join(themes, by = c("parent_id" = "id"), suffix = c("_child", "_parent") %>%
	filter(name_child == "The Lord of the Rings")
```
 
# 3. Full, Semi, and Anti Joins

## 3.1 The full_join verb

* `full_join` : keep all observations in both tables, whether or not they matched to each other?

```R
batmobile %>%
	full_join(batwing, by = c("part_num", "color_id"), suffix = c("_batmobile", "_batwing")) %>%
	replace_na(list(quantity_batmobile = 0, quantity_batwing = 0))
```

## 3.2 The semi- and anti-join verbs

* **Mutating verbs**

	* `inner_join`
	* `left_join`
	* `right_join`
	* `full_join`

* **Filtering joins**

	* Keeps or removes observations from the first table
	* Doesn't add new variables
	* `semi_join()` : What observations in X are also in Y?
	
	```R
	batmobile %>%
		semi_join(batwing, by = c("color_id", "part_num"))
		
	themes %>%
		semi_join(sets, by = c("id" = "theme_id"))
	```
	
	* `anti_join()` : What observations in X are not in Y?

	```R
	batmobile %>%
		anti_join(batwing, by = c("color_id", "part_num"))
		
	themes %>%
		anti_join(sets, by = c("id" = "theme_id"))
	```


## 3.3 Visualizing set differences

```R
# Aggregating sets into colors

batmobile_colors <- batmobile %>%
	group_by(color_id) %>%
	summarize(total = sum(quantity))
	
batwing_color <- batwing %>%
	group_by(color_id) %>%
	summarize(total = sum(quantity))
	
# Comparing color schemes of sets

batmobile_colors %>%
	full_join(batwing_colors, by = "color_id", suffix = c("_batmobile", "_batwing")) %>%
	raplace_na(list(total_batmobile = 0, total_batwing = 0)) %>%
	
	# Adding the color names
	inner_join(colors, by = c("color_id" = "id")) %>%

	# Adding fractions, the difference between fractions
	mutate(total_batmobile = total_batmobile / sum(total_batmobile),
		total_batwing = total_batwing / sum(total_batwing),
		difference = total_batmobile - total_batwing)

# Visualizing the data

library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)

color_palette <- setNames(color_joined$rgb, color_joined$name)

color_joined %>%
	mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, difference)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(name, difference, fill = name)) +
	geom_col() +
	coord_flip() +
	scale_fill_manual(values = color_palette, guide = FALSE)
```
	
# 4. Case Study : Join on Stack Overflow Data

## 4.1 Stack Overflow questions

```R
questions_with_tags <- questions %>%
	# join questions with the question tags table, based on their question id
	inner_join(question_tags, by = c("id" = "question_id")) %>%
	# join the tags table into the result, matching tag id to id
	inner_join(tags, by = c("tag_id" = "id"))

# Most common tags
question_with_tags %>%
	count(tag_name, sort = TRUE)
```

## 4.2 Joining questions and answers

## 4.3 The bind_rows verb

* **Binding rows**

```R
questions %>%
	bind_rows(answers)
```

```R
questions_type <- questions %>%
	mutate(type = "question")
	
answers_type <- answers %>%
	mutate(type = "answer")

posts <- bind_rows(questions_type, answers_type)
```

* **Aggregating

```R
posts %>%
	group_by(type) %>%
	summarize(average_score = mean(score))
```

* **Creating date variable**

```R
library(lubridate)

posts %>%
	mutate(year = year(creation_date)) %>%
	count(year, type)
```

* **Plotting date variable**

```R
questions_answers_year <- posts %>%
	mutate(year = year(creation_date)) %>%
	count(year, type)

ggplot(questions_answers_year, aes(year, n, color = type)) +
	geom_line()
```
