# Chapter 11  Regular expressions

* **`import re`** : import the regular expression library before using it

* **`re.search()` function**

```python
# search for lines that contain 'From'
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt') 
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('From:', line):
        print(line)
```

   * `line.find()` can do the same result

```python
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.find('From:') >= 0:
        print(line)
```

   * `re.search()` allow us to do sophisticated matching when we add special characters
      * `^` caret character: match the beginning of a line

```python
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From:', line):
        print(line)
```  

      * `line.startswith()` can do the same result

```python
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
```

## 11.1 Character matching in regular expressions

* `.` dot or period or full stop character: match any character
   * `F..m:`: 'From:', 'F12m:', 'F!@m:' ...

```python
# search for lines that start with 'F', followed by 2 characters, followed by 'm:'
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt') 
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^F..m:', line):
        print(line)
```

*  `*` or `+` characters: a character can be repeated any number of times
   *  `.+` or `.*` : one or more characters

```python
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From:.+@', line):
        print(line)
```

## 11.2 Extracting data using regular expressions

* `re.findall()` method

   * `\S+` matches as many non-whitespace characters as possible

```python
import re
s = 'A message from csev@umich.edu to cwen@iupui.edu about meeting @2PM'
lst = re.findall('\S+@\S+', s)
print(lst)

['csev@umich.edu', 'cwen@iupui.edu']
```

```python
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt') 
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    x = re.findall('\S+@\S+', line) 
    if len(x) > 0:
        print(x)
```

* `[a-zA-Z0-9]\S*@\S*[a-zA-Z]` : start with a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or number “[a-zA-Z0-9]”, followed by zero or more non-blank characters (\S*), followed by an at-sign, followed by zero or more non-blank characters (\S*), followed by an uppercase or lowercase letter. 

```python
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt') 
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    x = re.findall('[a-zA-Z0-9]\S+@\S+[a-zA-Z]', line) 
    if len(x) > 0:
        print(x)
```

* `[0-9]+` : one or more digits

```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
>>> y = re.findall('[0-9]+', x)
>>> print(y)
['2', '19', '42']
>>> y = re.findall('[AEIOU]+', x)
>>> print(y)
[]
```
* Greedy Matching: The repeat characters (* and +) push outward in both directions (greedy) to match the largest possible string

```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'From: Using the : character'
>>> y = re.findall('^F.+:', x)
>>> print(y)
['From: Using the :']
```

* Non-Greedy Matching

```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'From: Using the : character'
>>> y = re.findall('^F.+?:', x)
>>> print(y)
['From:']
```
* Parentheses are not part of the match - but they tell where to start and stop what string to extract

```python
>>> y = re.findall('\S+@\S+',x)
>>> print(y)
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za']
>>> y = re.findall('^From (\S+@\S+)',x)
>>> print(y)
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za']
```

* String Parsing Examples

> From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008

```python
>>> data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008'
>>> atpos = data.find('@')
>>> print(atpos)
21
>>> sppos = data.find(' ',atpos)
>>> print(sppos)
31
>>> host = data[atpos+1 : sppos]
>>> print(host)
uct.ac.za
```

```python
# Double Split Pattern
>>> line = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008'
>>> words = line.split()
>>> email = words[1]
>>> pieces = email.split('@')
>>> print(pieces[1])
uct.ac.za
```

```python
# Regex version
>>> import re
>>> lin = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008'
>>> y = re.findall('@([^ ]*)',lin)
>>> print(y)
['uct.ac.za']
```

```python
>>> import re 
>>> lin = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008'
>>> y = re.findall('^From .*@([^ ]*)',lin)
>>> print(y)
['uct.ac.za']
```

## 11.3 Combining searching and extracting

> If we want to find numbers on lines that start with the string “X-” such as:   
> X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475      
> X-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000   

* `^X-.*: [0-9.]+` : start with X-, followed by zero or more characters (.*), followed by a colon (:) and then a space. After the space we are looking for one or more characters that are either a digit (0-9) or a period [0-9.]+. 

```python
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt') 
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^X\S*: [0-9.]+', line):
        print(line)
        
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
X-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.6178
X-DSPAM-Probability: 0.0000
```
```python
>>> import re
>>> hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
>>> for line in hand:
...     line = line.rstrip()
...     x = re.findall('^X\S*: ([0-9.]+)', line)
...     if len(x) > 0:
...         print(x)
... 
['0.8475']
['0.0000']
['0.6178']
['0.0000']
...
```
```python
>>> import re
>>> hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
>>> for line in hand:
...     line = line.rstrip()
...     x = re.findall('^Details:.*rev=([0-9.]+)', line)
...     if len(x) > 0:
...         print(x)
... 
['39772']
['39771']
['39770']
['39769']
['39766']
...
```

* `^From .* [0-9][0-9]:`

```python
>>> import re
>>> hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
>>> for line in hand:
...     line = line.rstrip()
...     x = re.findall('^From .* ([0-9][0-9]):', line)
...     if len(x) > 0: print(x)
... 
['09']
['18']
['16']
['15']
['15']
...
```

```python
>>> import re
>>> hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
>>> numlist = list()
>>> for line in hand:
...     line = line.rstrip()
...     stuff = re.findall('^X-DSPAM-Confidence: ([0-9.]+)', line)
...     if len(stuff) != 1 : continue
...     num = float(stuff[0])
...     numlist.append(num)
... 
>>> print('Maximum:', max(numlist))
Maximum: 0.9907
```

## 11.4 Escape character

```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'
>>> y = re.findall('\$[0-9.]+', x)
>>> y
['$10.00']
```

## 11.6 Debugging

* `help()`

```python
>>> help()
help> modules
```
* `dir()` : command to find the methods in the module as follows

```python
>>> import re
>>> dir(re)
[.. 'compile', 'copy_reg', 'error', 'escape', 'findall', 'finditer', 'match', 'purge', 'search', 'split', 'sre_compile', 'sre_parse', 'sub', 'subn', 'sys', 'template']
```

```python
>>> import re
>>> help(re.search)
Help on function search in module re:

search(pattern, string, flags=0)
    Scan through string looking for a match to the pattern, returning
    a Match object, or None if no match was found.
>>>
```

## 11.7 Glossary

* **brittle code** Code that works when the input data is in a particular format but is prone to breakage if there is some deviation from the correct format. We call this “brittle code” because it is easily broken.

* **greedy matching** The notion that the + and * characters in a regular expression expand outward to match the largest possible string.

* **grep** A command available in most Unix systems that searches through text files looking for lines that match regular expressions. The command name stands for “Generalized Regular Expression Parser”.

* **regular expression** A language for expressing more complex search strings. A regular expression may contain special characters that indicate that a search only matches at the beginning or end of a line or many other similar capa- bilities.

* **wild card** A special character that matches any character. In regular expressions the wild-card character is the period.

## Exercises

**Exercise 1: Write a simple program to simulate the operation of the grep command on Unix. Ask the user to enter a regular expression and count the number of lines that matched the regular expression:**

$ python grep.py    
Enter a regular expression: ^Author    
mbox.txt had 1798 lines that matched ^Author

$ python grep.py    
Enter a regular expression: ^X-    
mbox.txt had 14368 lines that matched ^X-  

$ python grep.py
Enter a regular expression: java$
mbox.txt had 4175 lines that matched java$


**Exercise 2: Write a program to look for lines of the form:**

New Revision: 39772

**Extract the number from each of the lines using a regular expression and the findall() method. Compute the average of the numbers and print out the average as an integer.**

Enter file:mbox.txt   
38549

Enter file:mbox-short.txt    
39756
