There are many tools for trimming reads and removing adapters, such as Trim Galore!, Trimmomatic, Cutadapt, skewer, AlienTrimmer, BBDuk, and the most recent SOAPnuke and fastp.

# Trim Galore

* Instrall Cutadapt <https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>



# skewer

* Task : adapter trimming
    * Detection and removal of adapter sequences
    * Insertion and deletion allowed in pattern matching
    * Targeted at Single End, Paired End (PE), and Long Mate Pair (LMP) reads
    * Demultiplexing of barcoded sequencing runs
    * Multi-threading support
    * Trimming based on phred quality scores
    * IUPAC characters for barcodes and adapters
    * Compressed input and output support

* designed for processing IIlumina paired-end sequences
