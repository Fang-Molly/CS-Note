* **accumulator** A variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result. 

* **counter** A variable used in a loop to count the number of times something hap- pened. We initialize a counter to zero and then increment the counter each time we want to “count” something.

* **decrement** An update that decreases the value of a variable.

* **initialize** An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be updated.

* **increment** An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one). 

* **infinite loop** A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied or for which there is no terminating condition.

* **iteration** Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a function that
calls itself or a loop.
